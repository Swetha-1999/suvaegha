  <h5> Hey suvae,<br>
  Hope u are doing good with alwyn. Am so happy that Am going to have an extended journey with you (TCS). Let's rewind from the first year memories. Innitally, I got confused by ur name. I thought you too as swetha but later I realized it as suvaegha(unique name bah). On first few weeks, you sat on my before bench and I used to admire your hair. You have thich hair(&#128512;). Apro apdiyae friends aanom. We at times resemble same. We are so talktative, foodies at the same time, we are sensitive too. I remember you saying about alwyn for the first time in machines lab. "Ena oru paiyan from school days love panran. Follow panuvan. Vaishu ku theriyum. Propose also panitan. Nanum accept panalam nu irukan." Ipdi lam cute ha blush panitae sonna.(ps: sentence construction may be wrong, but message is same). And u r so strong in love. Ne nadakradhu elamae soluva, edhum maraika maata. I like that most and that shows how much you trust us.<br><br>
  My birthday ku vetuku lam vandha. Forum onna ponum, adhan first time namma veliya ponadhu nenaikran. I still have ur coolers which you presented me. Workshops onna attend panom. Alwyn gang is so fun to be with. Am so happy that you got a perfect partner. That year mami vetuku kuda neyum nanum onna poi surprise panom. Nadu road la that bridge la selfiee eduthu, uk u are a good travel partner. My birthday kum enaku pidicha cake vangitu surprise ha vandha. Really I loved the cake and loved you guys for taking efforts for me. Nariya outings poirukom namma. Smoothie bar la lam funs panom. Un kuda bike rides also good. Still maraka matan andha dog ur area la namala follow panadhu. Namma second year apdiyae pochu.<br><br> 
  Certificate vanga perambur park vandha apo dha unga kuda first time church vandhan. I felt so comfortable with you guys. Ne en kitta elamae soluva. Though namma clg la avolova daily close ha pesala na also, epoaachu pakathula vandha apdiyae whole story, even friends story also soluva. It's really awesome. Na evolo days down ha irundha apo lam, you were with me. Made me laugh. Ipdiyae nalla poitu irundha namma gang ku yar kannu patuchu nu therila. problems came. It all started with SIH. Enamo SIH la onna panalam, projects lam onna panalam nu irundha namma split aanom. I don't blame you, but it happened. Enaku nanga SIH apo thaniya engala vitinga nu dha feel. Vera onum ila. Sudden ha neyum ponadhu oru mari airuchu. But adha anikae end pananum nu call lam panni 3 perum aniku aludhom. That's our friendship. Apro that avadi workshop apo elam normal aachu. Andha workshop apo one day, I was on the first day of my period and I had so much pain. But you comforted me, ena safe ha central ku kutitu pona. But enamo again knjm days la yae terms mismatched. Janu wedding times and that semester times la again sanda came. Enaku oru biggest varutham ena na, en birthday ku ena vituta mari feel aachu. IK it was semester time, but I was saddened. Arvind enaku surprise panan but friends ha nenga onum panala nu oru thought(call me even stupid, but I expected from frnds too!). But one thing am happy on you is, you came for me to that orphanage. Yarum unuku apo close ila, but u came only for me. My bday from first year la irundhu ne vandhuruka, am so grateful for that. Due to these feeling for friends and some misunderstandings naala I too over reacted on you guys. I constantly had a feeling that am not that much important so I was left as choice.

    <br><h5>Bangalore ticket bookings la also problems aachu and I left you guys, romba stress aadhu nu pesama poiralam nae decide panan. But trust me, ungaluku edho problem vetla nu therinja odanae, I texted you in message. Apo I felt like I still have ur friendship and I can't leave u nu. Bangalore was our first trip. Anga knjm things normal aara mari irundhalum, it was not fully. We felt awkward many times. All were hurted and we needed time to heal. After that one day clg la una thaniya vitom nu ne romba feel panna. That was not done intentionally, but nanga apdiyae vitom nu solalam. Avolo adhu hurt aagum nu therinja, I swear apdi paniruka maatan. IK how hard it is to be alone! Sorry for that . Sashu oda sister vetuku y vandhinga nu mami kitta ne keta nu IK. That hurted a lot. Yes aniku mrng engaluku poga edam ila, but If we had no other go, we would have directly went to CMRIT(even that was my plan actually). Raman also kuda irundhan. He came for us and so we had no other go but have to be with him. Enamo, within few days, may mid kulla namma kulla irundha hurdles elam kammi aachu. I thought things wont be back, but it was wrong.<br><br>
    Apro, we got busy with our placements. We struggled a lot and finally got placed in TCS. Tour was also good. Wonderlla la water rides epomae maraka matan life la. But ne kela vilundhadhu really kastama irundhuchu. You cried and u had hell lot of pain. But u showed that u are a strong girl. Situations ha bold ha face panna and u crossed that phase too. Train erum mothu avolo peru kuda irundhalum, you held my hands tightly. Apo I felt how much pain you were going through. Really tears rolled my eyes that time. Oru valiya train la eritom. Trust me, aniku night I didn't had proper sleep. Apo apo nanum mami yum una eti eti pathom. Central la una parents kitta vidum mothu dha enamo knjm relief aachu. After that too una paaka varanum nu romba nal nenachan. But laziness la apdiyae vitan. But ne oru nal feel panna like yarumae frnds nu vandhu pakala nu. I really felt bad at that time. We crossed that hard phase too. Ipo am happy that u became normal. Apro symposium was another best part. You looked good in saree. Lockdown la kuda enakaga bday ku video panna. Am really happy on seeing that. Am happy that you took efforts to make me happy and thats all I want.<br><br>
    Feeling so light now. On this friendhip day, I just ask you for one thing. "Keep in touch" forever. Wherever you go, whatever position you are in, 'remember me' and thats all I want from you. Stay blessed with Alwyn and IK your career will be great!. Hope you loved this page! and our four years journey splashed I guess. Take care, Stay safe, vetla elarum ketadha sollu. Before winding up, take a quick look at this.
